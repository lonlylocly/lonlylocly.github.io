## How does one gets to know what's going on?

### A word on how do we interact to each other

Imagine a day without any word heard from other people.
Quiet impossible and creepy, isn't it?

We talk to each other, we write emails, do texting by phone, 
send messages, write blog posts, read blog posts, and comment them.

Every bit of information coming through our brain produces some reaction.
Most of times it is *ignorance*, but from time to time we *respond*.

There begins association between words heard and words replied.
These words are chained together, they form a new specie -- **a conversation**.

### Ah, Twitter again

Yes, we do talk a lot at Twitter. It allows not only share your current thinking,
but also comment on someone else's current thinking. Twitter is tremendous source
of public conversations.
